# BOTEL

This is a concept of a Hotel Booking Web App. The app allows users to view and book available rooms in a hotel.

The hotels and rooms are created by an admin and are posted to an API. The data posted to the API is then fetched and displayed on the user's dashboard.

# FEATURES

- Users can sign into a dashboard to see all rooms and hotels which are available for booking.

- Admins have access to a separate dashboard where they create hotels and add rooms to hotels to be displayed on the user's dashboard.
